  <para>A RepRap 3D printer is most often used to print either of two
  thermoplastics: ABS or PLA. The plastic material is arranged in
  filament.</para>

  <para>ABS and PLA are very different plastics and they each require specific
  printer configurations. ABS is made from petroleum and is more flexible than
  PLA. PLA is biodegradable, is more rigid than ABS and will dissolve in
  water. ABS is more prone to warping than PLA. Good printing results will
  require a heatbed for ABS. For PLA you can probably get printed parts
  without warping without a heatbed.</para>

  <para>There are many different kinds of ABS and PLA. If your printer is
  perfectly tuned for the plastic of one vendor you might need to redo your
  configuration after youâ€™ve switched vendors. PLA has a lower melting
  temperature than ABS. Take into account however that the thermistor on a
  NiChrome wire hotend typically reports lower than actual temperatures. A
  thermistor on a heatblock typically reports higher than actual
  temperatures.</para>

  <para>Your hotend temperature, extruder speed and axes speeds all need to be
  in harmony for good printing results. First try to get good printing results
  at a lower extruder speed (100mm per second). Afterwards you can try to
  increase the speed. As a rule of thumb printing quality at higher speeds
  will be worse than at lower speeds although the degradation is usually
  acceptable.</para>
