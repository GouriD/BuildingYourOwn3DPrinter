>You can't build a RepRap and make it work without a digital caliper. If you have a normal caliper put it to the side and order a digital caliper. The digital caliper gives a readout of two significant digits after the comma. The digital caliper is required while calibrating your frame and later when calibrating your axes. You can find reliable digital calipers on Amazon for $10 or €10.</para

> with bushing holders integrated in the printed parts. The original purpose was to glue small pieces of felt into these holders (felt was then used as a bushing.) It is also possible to mount brass bushings in these holder. Later on the parts for LM8UU bearings were also added to this branch. The use of felt as a bushing never really caught on and is now outdated. The bushing holders integrated into the parts are still popular for use with brass bushings and LM8UU linear bearings. <link
